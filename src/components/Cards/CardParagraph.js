//   Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with artichokes and
//   peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed,
//   15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved shrimp and
//   mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again without stirring,
//   until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7 minutes more.
//   (Discard any mussels that donâ€™t open.)
//   </Typography>
//   <Typography>
//     Set aside off of the heat to let rest for 10 minutes, and then serve.
